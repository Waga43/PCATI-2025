This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!

Modern public health demands that decisions should be science-based and knowledge-based. As far as possible, policy-making should be made only after objective analysis of relevant information. Where information is lacking, there is a clear indication for gathering data and carrying out research to inform decision-making. It is often stated that researchers should present their results in a way that decision-makers can apply their findings. By the same token, policy-makers have the responsibility to ensure that their decisions are based on the best available scientific evidence.
