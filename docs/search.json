Welcome!\nModern public health demands that decisions should be science-based and knowledge-based. As far as possible, policy-making should be made only after objective analysis of relevant information. Where information is lacking, there is a clear indication for gathering data and carrying out research to inform decision-making. It is often stated that researchers should present their results in a way that decision-makers can apply their findings. By the same token, policy-makers have the responsibility to ensure that their decisions are based on the best available scientific evidence.\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⛔/ Caution\n\n\n\nTake note of the following points:\n\nWrite your name\nWrite your registration number\nAttempt all questions\n\n\n\n\nMyFirstTable\n\n\nS/no\nName\nSex\n\n\n\n\n1\nWaga\nF\n\n\n2\nSigi\nM\n\n\n3\nUngu\nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\nA definition of terms\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Python Coding!!!\nThank you.\nWe are highly\nelated to see you\ndear friend.\nHave a swell time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2025, PCATI 2025.

These gaps include:\n\nlimited awareness of diverse career opportunities in physiology\ninadequate adoption of advanced teaching methodologies\ninsufficient research capacity.\n\nBy targeting these challenges, the initiative seeks to inspire, empower, and equip participants with the knowledge, skills, and tools required to excel in the field of physiology."

    "section": "Project Focus",
    "text": "Project Focus\nThe Project Focuses on Three Key objectives:\n\nRaising Awareness about Diverse Physiology Careers: Despite the vast potential of physiology as a discipline, many students and graduates in LMICs are unaware of the diverse career paths it offers, ranging from academia and research to industry and clinical applications. This initiative will bridge this gap through inspirational presentations by renowned speakers, interactive round table discussions, and participant-led sessions. By showcasing success stories and pathways, the program will motivate students, graduates, and professionals to explore and pursue rewarding careers in physiology.\nImproving & Enhancing Physiology Teaching: Traditional teaching methods often fall short in engaging students and preparing them for modern challenges. This program will introduce advanced teaching technologies, such as Virtual Reality (VR) for immersive and interactive learning experiences, and use of Learning Management Systems (LMS) for improving engagement and providing dynamic assessment tools. These innovations will not only make learning more effective but also enhance the overall teaching quality in institutions. By training educators in these technologies, the initiative will empower them to modernize their teaching practices, thereby addressing the gap in contemporary physiology education in LMICs.\nBuilding Research and Clinical Capacity: In LMICs including Nigeria, physiology research is often constrained by limited expertise and access to advanced techniques and tools. This initiative will provide hands-on workshops in molecular biology techniques (nucleic acids extraction, PCR & gel electrophoresis), data analysis, and the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into research. These sessions will equip participants with skills critical for cutting-edge research, enabling them to contribute to global scientific advancements. Additionally, clinical training in Basic Life Support (BLS), Electrocardiography (ECG), and Spirometry will provide participants especially students and graduates with practical skills that improve their employability and contribution to the healthcare sector helping to improve the healthcare outcome in the community.\n\nThrough these approaches, this initiative addresses current gaps by promoting a collaborative and inclusive environment. Participants from various institutions and regions will engage in practical demonstrations, brainstorming sessions, and small group projects, encouraging the exchange of ideas and skills. The program also aims to establish a robust network of physiologists who can support each other in overcoming challenges unique to LMICs.\nThe expected outcomes include improved increased awareness of diverse Physiology career opportunities, improved teaching methodologies, enhanced research capabilities and expertise, and the development of essential clinical skills among participants. These will lead to better employability, increased research output, and strengthened regional and international collaborations"

    "text": "Target Participants\nThe “Physiology Career Awareness and Training Initiative” is designed to engage a diverse audience while maintaining an optimal size for effective participation. We anticipate hosting 60 to 100 participants, ensuring broad representation across academia, industry, healthcare, and government sectors, while facilitating meaningful engagement and impact.\nOur primary audience includes undergraduate and postgraduate students, lecturers, and researchers from institutions across Northern and Southern Nigeria. Additionally, stakeholders from industries such as pharmaceuticals and Technological industries, relevant stakeholders from government agencies, and clinicians will be invited. To enhance regional collaboration, we will also engage participants from neighboring countries, particularly the Republic of Niger which is not very far from Kano State Nigeria thus expanding the participation and engagement in the West African sub region.\nPractical training workshops will have specified participant limits and targeted groups to maximize relevance and engagement as follows:\n\nECG Training: Targeting students and graduates interested in clinical physiology; maximum 20 participants.\nBLS Training: Students, graduates & professionals seeking lifesaving skills; maximum 20 participants.\nVR Training for Teaching: Tailored for students and educators aiming to enhance physiology teaching using immersive technologies; maximum of 15 participants.\nSpirometry Training: Targeting researchers and students interested in respiratory physiology applications; maximum 15 participants.\nMolecular Biology Techniques Training: Geared towards researchers and postgraduate students eager to expand their research capacity in molecular physiology; maximum of 10 participants.\nLearning Management System (LMS) Training: Targeting lecturers and teaching assistants to empower them with interactive tools for modern teaching; maximum of 20 participants.\n\nThe program will feature expert trainers and speakers in modern physiology teaching, molecular biology, referencing tools, data analysis, and industry applications. Combining targeted workshops with plenary events, this initiative ensures inclusiveness and impactful learning. It creates a dynamic platform to inspire and equip the next generation of physiologists."
