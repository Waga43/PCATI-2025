## Profile/Citation

Mrs. Samirah's academic journey is driven by a strong passion for life sciences, with a focus on biology and biotechnology. She holds a B.Sc. in Applied Biology and a PGD in Biotechnology, which provided her with solid training in molecular diagnostics, genetic engineering, and bioinformatics.

To gain hands-on experience, she completed a 3-month internship in Toxicology at the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), Vom, sponsored by the Nduwaka Educational Foundation, USA. There, she was trained in toxicological screening, animal models, and laboratory safety.

She is currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Biotechnology, deepening my expertise in genomics, molecular biology, and bioethics. She also has hands-on proficiency in using the CODA non-invasive blood pressure system, and has successfully guided students and researchers in measuring physiological parameters for experimental research.

Her long-term goal is to contribute to cutting-edge research in genetic diseases, cancer biology, and experimental animal studies.
